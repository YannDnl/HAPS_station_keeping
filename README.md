# HAPS_station_keeping

The aim of this project is to constantly have a balloon (high-altitude platform station, HAPS) covering a precise zone. We decided to use a fleet of balloon and to minimize the number of balloon for the zone to be covered 100% of the time.

We decided to control each balloon independantly with the same agent, for the code to be robust to change in the size of the fleet. The agent is trained using reinforcement learning algorithms.
